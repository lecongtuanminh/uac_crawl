This is a Python script that uses the Selenium library to scrape information about undergraduate courses from the University Admissions Centre (UAC) website. The script prompts the user to input a course and then navigates to the UAC website to search for and filter relevant courses. The script then extracts information from each course page and stores the data in a Pandas DataFrame, which is then exported to a CSV file.
